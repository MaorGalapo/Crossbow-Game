# Crossbow-Game
A game I created as a project in high school
Controls are simple: 
player 1:
WASD to move and t to shoot

player 2: 
arrow keys to move and right ctrl to shoot

there are power ups implemented in the game and the game goes to 3 or until the timer ends.

There are three power ups I implemented :
Poison dart : Poisons player hit for damage over time
Explosive dart : Explodes, dealing damage to nearby players
Sniper shot : Shoots a very fast almost straight dart
Health Up : replenishes health

Because of the way I implemented the power ups, a player may combine the powers of sniper dart with either poison or explosive dart.
(I intended to make a poisonous explosion, but I had to move on to other school work instead).
